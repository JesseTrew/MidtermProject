### Why we built PET BnB
- We want to help pet owners find a place for their pets while they are away and allow hosts or people that can provide pet services an opportunity to build their reputation and give service to others.
### Methodologies used to build the application
- Group project - Pair programming by having someone drive while the other person reviews the code being worked on and assisting the driver with ideas and what to input - Swarming by having all team members collaboratively working on in progress items and finishing it before starting work on new items.
- Agile - Collaborative group development, using Kanban and Scrum to work to set requirements and look over solutions as a team. Having frequent inspections to see the status of everyones progress and promote self-organization and accountability and getting help from others.
- Scrum - a subset of Agile methodology that provides framework to allow adjustments to rapidly-changing requirements by holding a daily scrum meeting where members stand and alloted a brief time to go over to the group about what have they accomplished since last meeting, what they plan to do until the next meeting, and what the is keeping them from doing their job.
### Lessons Learned

### Stretch Goals
1. Calendar feature for reservations, specifically blocking out dates the host cannot do, and showing what their availability is to users searching for a host
2. Breeding matching, a place for people who want to breed their pet with another, and another stretch goal would be to have filters to be more specific of what they want their pet to breed with
3. A listing of pet events in the area
4. Recipes based on ingredients for what pet friendly recipes they can make for their pet
